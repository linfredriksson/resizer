# Image Resizer
Small application that can be used to mass resize .png images. I made this small tool when i needed to resize thousands of .png images generated from a simple ray-tracer to be used in some shorter demonstration videos.

The application allows for selection of directory for original images, destination directory for resized images, adding of prefix/suffix to the filenames of the resized images, and more.
